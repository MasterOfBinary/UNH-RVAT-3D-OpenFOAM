UNH-RVAT 3-D OpenFOAM case files
================================

At Time = 0.233108, pressure solver iterations go way up and case slows down. 

Failed 4 mesh checks at Time = 0.1; okay otherwise. Creating a group of bad cells trying to
move the turbine. Could be moving from processor to processor.
